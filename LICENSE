Details
-------

Dean Hall is the copyright holder for all files in src/vm.
Dean Hall is the majority copyright holder for all other files
in Python-on-a-Chip with these exceptions:

Bryan Jones contributed all files in src/platform/pic24.
James Snyder contributed all files in src/platform/stm32.

Python-on-a-Chip was formerly offered under a dual-license:
a commercial license and the GPL.  On 2012/08/29, Dean Hall
changed the license to the MIT License for all files except those
in src/platform/.  This license change applies only to the r09 release
and specifically does not apply to the software in the repository under
the v10 branch.


Net Effect
----------

The cumulitive effect of the licensing above results in the r09 code having
a very liberal license and obtaining a commercial license from Dean Hall is
no longer necessary for the r09 code.

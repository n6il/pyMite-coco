====================
The Desktop Platform
====================

:Author:    Dean Hall


Purpose
-------

This is a sample project that demonstrates running Python-on-a-Chip on the
desktop.  Any POSIX-compliant OS should work (Mac OS X, Linux, Cygwin).
An MS Windows command shell is NOT POSIX-compliant, if you want to run in
a windows command shell, use the ``windows`` platform instead.


Building the Project
--------------------

Start with a clean source tree.

The desktop64 is the default platform of the makefile build system,
so you need to specify the 32-bit desktop when typing ``make``::

    $ make PLATFORM=desktop

The default application is to run the interactive prompt, ipm.  
To run the host-side of ipm and launch the target-side type::

    $ make ipm

Read ``docs/src/InteractivePyMite.txt`` to learn how to run ipm.
